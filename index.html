                I don't have hate in my heart — just memories. Memories of the way we used to talk for hours, the way I cared without holding back, and the way I truly believed I would be there on days like this.
            </p>
            <p class="birthday-message">
                I once imagined celebrating this day beside you, being the one who makes you smile first. Instead, I'm standing at a distance, wishing you well in a way I never thought I would have to.
            </p>
            <p class="birthday-message">
                I won't lie — being with you wasn't always easy for me. There were moments when you made me feel jealous in ways that drove me crazy. Not because I didn't trust you, but because I cared too much. Sometimes it felt like my feelings were being tested, and I was fighting battles inside my head that I never wanted to fight. I wish you understood how much that affected me.
            </p>
            <p class="birthday-message">
                Still, I hope this year brings you clarity, peace, and the happiness you were searching for when you chose to let me go. I hope you find everything you felt was missing — even if that meant it wasn't me.
            </p>
            <p class="birthday-message">
                Despite everything, I truly wish you a beautiful day. Some feelings don't turn into hate… they just turn into quiet memories.
